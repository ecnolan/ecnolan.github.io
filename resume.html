   <ul class="a">
     <li> Conducted independent research analyzing online chess social network
       structure, including evaluation of meaningfulness of online chess
       ranking. Compared network associativity with in-person chess to confirm
       efficacy of ranking system.</li>
     <li> Taught myself relevant network analysis tools including networkX
       python package and Cytoscape program. </li>
     <li> Submitted research paper to lichess.org, including proposing new
       network-diameter based method to identify cheating. </li>

   <ul class="a">
     <li> Collaborated with small team to develop two computationally efficient,
       meaningful, and easy-to-use spline fitting methods used to reconstruct
       past climates from tree-ring data. These methods replace Cook & Peters
       1981 approach.</li>
     <li>Analyzed tree-ring data from over 2,000 geographically diverse trees
       to develop and test accuracy of our methods.</li>
     <li>Adapted modern math techniques to accommodate niche biological
       research applications, wrote code to implement method in R with
       transparent methodology. Wrote paper synthesizing
       research outcomes and detailing method implementation.</li>
