  </p>
   <ul class="a">
     <li> Conducted independent research analyzing online chess social network
       structure. Evaluated meaningfulness of online chess ranking. Compared
       network associativity with in-person chess to confirm efficacy of ranking
       system.</li>
     <li> Taught myself relevant network analysis tools including networkX python
        package and Cytoscape program. </li>
     <li> Submitted research paper to lichess.org, including proposing new
       network-diameter based method to identify cheating. </li>
   </ul>

   <p>
     Mathematics Researcher <br>
     <span class="loc"> Elon University and NCA&T Joint REU in Mathematical
       Biology</span>
     <span class="date" > May 2021-August 2021 </span>
   </p>
   <ul class="a">
     <li> Collaborated with small team to develop two computationally efficient,
       meaningful, and easy-to-use spline fitting methods used to reconstruct
       past climates from tree-ring data. These methods replace Cook & Peters
       1981 approach.</li>
     <li>Analyzed tree-ring data from over 2,000 geographically diverse trees
       to develop and test accuracy of our methods.</li>
     <li>Adapted modern math techniques to accommodate niche biological
       research applications, wrote code to implement method in R with
       transparent methodology. Wrote a peer-reviewed paper synthesizing
       research outcomes and detailing method implementation.</li>
