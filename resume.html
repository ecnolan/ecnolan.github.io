       online chess platform, including evaluation of player ranking accuracy.
       Compared network associativity with in-person chess to confirm efficacy
       of ranking system. </li>
     <li> Identified and taught myself relevant packages and tools including
       networkX Python package and Cytoscape program. </li>
     <li> Submitted research paper proposing new network-diameter method for
       game developers to identify fraudulent accounts. </li>
