     <h4>Lichess Social Network Analysis</h4>
     <p > Analysis of the structure of social networks of online chess websites.
       Worked with peer Valentin Scognamillo to look at data from chess games played
       on lichess.org. Focus was on evaluating the efficacy of the player-ranking
       system used on the side. We then looked into abnormalities in the structure,
       particularly communities of high-associativity players, which indicated
       players' tendancies to to show preference to a single game type.
       We also found that players on long branches have a tendancy to be involved
       in ranking-manipulation, and propose that cheating can be found by
       investigating play history of users who's nodes fall on the longest shortest paths.
       <br>
       We used python to process our large dataset. We used Cytoscape and Gephi
       for our network visualizations.

     <!-- Tree research -->
     <h4>Dendrochronologial Smoothing Spline Research </h4>
     <p> The project focus was to develop alternative techniques for fitting
       smoothing splines in the field of dendrochronology. Since 1981, the Cook
       & Peters method has been used to fit splines to tree-ring width data to
       obtain a spline with a 50% reduction in frequency. Since its development,
       smoothing splines have advanced significantly, and we aimed to find a more
       computationally efficient and meaningful technique for choosing the
       smoothing parameter. We implemented and tested our methods in R, comparing
       them against the dplR method currently used by dendrochronologists.

       My research partner and I developed two alternative techniques that
       achieve aproximately the same level of smoothing, but are more straightforward
       in use and have more mathematical meaning. Most importantly, both of our
       methods cut out the use of the forier transform, thus we greatly increase
       the computational effiency.

       We tested our methods on 9 datasets for robustness. Individual datasets have
       between 20 and 100 trees, and each tree tends to have 50-150 data points.
       Our improved computational efficiency was apparent in our ability to
       process that amount of data much faster than the original method could. <br>
