     <h4>Dendrochronologial Smoothing Spline Research </h4>
     <p> The project focus was to develop alternative techniques for fitting
       smoothing splines in the field of dendrochronology. Since 1981, the Cook
       & Peters method has been used to fit splines to tree-ring width data to
       obtain a spline with a 50% reduction in frequency. Since its development,
       smoothing splines have advanced significantly, and we aimed to find a more
       computationally efficient and meaningful technique for choosing the
       smoothing parameter. We implemented and tested our methods in R, comparing
       them against the dplR method currently used by dendrochronologists.

       My research partner and I developed two alternative techniques that
       achieve aproximately the same level of smoothing, but are more straightforward
       in use and have more mathematical meaning. Most importantly, both of our
       methods cut out the use of the forier transform, thus we greatly increase
       the computational effiency.

       We tested our methods on 9 datasets for robustness. Individual datasets have
       between 20 and 100 trees, and each tree tends to have 50-150 data points.
       Our improved computational efficiency was apparent in our ability to
       process that amount of data much faster than the original method could. <br>
